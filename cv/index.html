      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p>I like to explore and analyze! I especially enjoy creating tools to extract data, analyze and explain unknown phenomena in any ICT system, at any scale.</p>
      <p>I am happily doing this as a Senior Threat Researcher at <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/">Trend Micro’s Forward-Looking Threat Research (FTR) team</a>. The team’s mission is to scout the future for novel security risks and threats.</p>
      <h3 id="activities">Activities</h3>
      <p>For the past 17 years I have had both industrial and academic work experience, as an employee, professor, and consultant. As such, I have experience dealing with various realms, from large corporate environments, research laboratories, to small companies.</p>
      <p>My work activities range from pure development to research, including both technical and dissemination tasks. In the past, I’ve done vulnerability assessment and web penetration-testing activities as a consultant, and I was hired multiple times as a technical expert witness for courts in Italy. Being member of various review boards and scientific program committees, I have extensive experience in assessing the quality of technical documents and other scientific artifacts.</p>
      <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <p>Although I enjoy doing research in really any area of computer security, my experience includes various topics under the “cyber security” and “cyber crime” umbrella terms, such as threat analysis and intelligence, malware analysis, mobile security, fraud analysis and detection, web- and social-network security, and data visualization for security.</p>
      <p>A distinctive aspect of my work is that I always strive to follow data-driven or learning-based approaches. The most recent example is a large-scale, <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/defplorex-machine-learning-toolkit-large-scale-ecrime-forensics/">data-analysis tool</a> that I developed to find web-defacement campaigns. In agreement with the employer, I’ve partially <a href="https://github.com/trendmicro/defplorex">open-sourced the tool</a> after demoing it at Black Hat US Arsenal (2017). I’ve worked on similar projects on other topics: botnet data analysis and intelligence, mobile ransomware analysis, banking fraud intelligence, malware behavior mining, web-scale threat measurements, anomaly detection.</p>
      <h3 id="research-dissemination-and-speaking-experience">Research Dissemination and Speaking Experience</h3>
      <p>I published tenths of research papers at refereed international conferences or journals, as well as technical white papers and <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/author/federicom/">technical blog posts</a>. I’ve presented my work at various international venues including both academic and industrial conferences (e.g., Black Hat), as well as closed-door events.</p>
      <p>Thanks to my extensive teaching experience, I have acquired professional proficency at speaking to and engaging with various types of audiences in both English and Italian languaeg. Thanks to these activities, I’ve grown accustomed to travel internationally and interact with a variety of cultures.</p>
      <p>My work has been recognized by several research groups (UC Santa Barbara, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Northeaster Univeristy, Stony Brook University, KU Leven, and Royal Holloway University of London), with which I collaborated in various occasions.</p>
      <h3 id="teamwork-and-management-experience">Teamwork and Management Experience</h3>
      <p>In addition to teamwork in small groups of researchers, I have been teaching computer programming, computer and network security, digital forensics, and information systems. Since 2014 I was a professor for the Computer Security course and co-teach Advanced Topics in Computer Security.</p>
      <p>I coordinated the organization of computer-security challenges and international competitions (CTFs). I’ve advised several PhD students. During my research projects, I am keen to involve people actively and work closely with them. During my academic career, this resulted in more than 35 theses and hundreds of people that I supervised since 2009.</p>
      <h3 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills</h3>
      <p>R&amp;D activities highly demand flexibility, and thus I’m always keen to learn a new technology. Thanks to this, I have gained hands-on experience with a wide variety of technical development and research tools, at all levels of the modern ICT stack: from a disassembler or other command-line tools, to full-fledged web-development frameworks, storage systems, as well as dev-ops or system-administration tools.</p>

      <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
      <p>My research activity revolves around a multitude of topics in the area of cyber security and e-crime, with a spin on data-analysis-oriented approaches.</p>
      <h3 id="research-topics">Research Topics</h3>
      <p>I focus on analysis and mitigation of current and future threats using data analysis. I’ve been using ML since the beginning of my academic career. Nowadays, there is a lot of hype around machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), and sometimes these two branches of science are brutally confused, to the point that people write “ML/AI” or say “ML or AI,” like they were synonyms. I prefer to take a step back, and simply say that I use data-analysis techniques, which has a much broader meaning. In particular, I do research on threat analysis and intelligence, malware analysis (including mobile malware), banking fraud analysis and detection, web and social-network security, vishing (voice phishing), and measurement. In addition, I did contributions in the field of security visualization.</p>
      <p>In the past I made contributions in the field of anomaly detection: I developed and tested anomaly-based tools to mitigate Internet threats by (1) avoiding their spread via vulnerable web applications, (2) detecting unexpected activities in the operating system’s kernel (sing of malware infections or compromised processes), and (3) dealing with high number of alerts using alert correlation.</p>
      <p>I occasionally extend my research beyond such topics: I let new ideas grow into research projects and involve multiple research institutions as needed by the specific vertical.</p>
      <h3 id="highlighted-projects">Highlighted Projects</h3>
      <p>When I’m involved in a research project, I always make an effort to leave some online artifact to demonstrate the idea, being it a simple web application or, sometimes, the source code. I hereby highlight the main research projects that I’ve contributed to, in reverse chronological order.</p>
      <h4 id="robosec-industrial-robot-security">Robosec: Industrial Robot Security</h4>
      <p>Industrial robots are complex cyber-physical systems used for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern factory. Besides the mechanical arm, inside an industrial robot there are not just electromechanical components but a multitude of complex embedded controllers. These embedded controllers are often interconnected with other computers in the factory network, safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring and maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also play a key role, because they directly expose the robot’s controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.</p>

      <h4 id="can-dos-denial-of-service-on-in-vehicle-networks">CAN DoS: Denial of Service on In-vehicle Networks</h4>
      <p>In many instances, researchers and engineers have found ways to hack into modern, internet-capable cars, as has been documented and reported several times. One famous example is the Chrysler Jeep hack that researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek discovered. This hack and those that have come before it have mostly been reliant on specific vulnerabilities in specific makes and/or brands of cars. And once reported, these vulnerabilities were quickly resolved. But what should the security industry’s response be when a hack is found that is not only successful in being able to drastically affect the performance and function of the car, but is also stealthy and vendor neutral?</p>

      <p>Called DefPloreX (a play on words from “Defacement eXplorer”) is a flexible toolkit based on open-source libraries for efficiently analyzing millions of defaced web pages. It can also be used on web pages planted as a result of an attack in general. It uses a combination of machine-learning and visualization techniques to turn unstructured data into meaningful high-level descriptions. The most interesting aspect of DefPloreX is that it automatically groups similar defaced pages into clusters, and organizes web incidents into campaigns. Requiring only one pass on the data, the clustering technique we use is intrinsically parallel and not memory bound.</p>

      <p>The main goal is to provide a dashboard to analyze and monitor the spreading of Android malware in marketplaces. AndRadar uses lightweight fingerprints to lookup malware samples without the need to download them from the markets. Once a matching app is found, AndRadar tracks its page, developer, and any kind of meta data associated to it. AndRadar’s data is then crunched into a set of indicators that summarize, for example, the efficiency of a malware author in publishing its app, the speed of the market in responding to threats, etc., and provide an overall reputation of each developer, market and app. By combining data coming from different marketplaces, AndRadar can track spreading campaigns also across markets. No such tool like AndRadar exists so far, so we released it to the public.</p>

In this context, one single mistake could open the application (and, therefore, the entire device) to serious security vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution.

      <p>The goal was to process the blockchain to find clusters of Bitcoin wallets that belonged to the same real user. BitIodine classifies such users and labels them, and finally visualizes complex information extracted from the Bitcoin network. Labels are enriched with information on the user’s identity and actions, which are automatically scraped from openly available information sources. BitIodine also supports manual investigation by finding paths and reverse paths between addresses or users. We tested BitIodine on several real-world use cases, identified an address likely to belong to the encrypted Silk Road cold wallet, and investigated the CryptoLocker ransomware and accurately quantified the number of ransoms paid, as well as information about the victims.</p>

      <h4 id="heldroid-mobile-ransomware-analysis-and-detection">HelDroid: Mobile ransomware analysis and detection</h4>
      <p>The main goal is to find indicators of compromise that are generic enough to be able to detect unknown ransomware families. We focused on Android mainly for ease of prototyping, but the ideas can be ported to other OSs. HelDroid characterizes a ransomware from three angles: misuse of encryption, device locking and display of threatening text. HelDroid uses taint analysis to extract data flows that indicate misuse of crypto routines (e.g., read-encrypt- write cycles) and the use of device-locking techniques (e.g., display of immortal window). Any text extracted from the sample is analyzed using a natural language processing classifier, which is trained on samples of threatening vs. non-threatening sentences. We tested HelDroid on hundreds of thousands of samples and it exhibit very high recall with little errors, even on samples that the system has never seen. Thus, we released an API that can be used by anyone to submit suspicious APKs for analysis. On top of that, a PoC Android app has been built.</p>

      <p>The goal is to extract signatures that capture the WebInject behavior of trojans. WebInject-based trojans are still the most popular e-crime tool. Prometheus (formerly Zarathustra) is based on a technique that we call web page differential analysis, which extracts and generates a model of the differences between a web page visited from an infected (virtual) machine and the very same page visited from a clean machine. These differences are unavoidable for the malware to carry out its functionality, and thus allow to create robust indicators of compromise. We generalize these differences using custom heuristics to reduce the chances of false positives.</p>

BankSealer is based on lightweight statistical learning on feature models (e.g., amount, timestamp, recipient country, description) extracted by each transaction. BankSealer is currently deployed at one of the largest Italian banks and has been proven effective at detecting frauds, to the point that my co-authors have created a startup out of it!</p>

      <p>The main goal is to provide a malware tracker similar to ZeusTracker, but for mobile bankers. This tool uses static analysis to extract relevant C&amp;C endpoints (e.g., phone number, web URLs) and monitors them by running each sample in a sandbox on a daily basis. On top of this, DroydSeuss attaches meta data to both C&amp;C endpoints and malware samples (e.g., country, code feature) that are used to mine association rules. These rules are automatically extracted and can tell useful information such as “there is a group of malware samples that seem to be coming from the same author spreading in a certain country”. We made the tool public and immediately attracted other researcher’s attention. Thanks to the data feed produced by DroydSeuss we were able to find (and confirm) one malware campaign spreading against Chinese and Korean bank customers and to discover a strange, rare sample that was using Baidu as a C&amp;C.</p>

      <p>Spying on a person is an easy and effective method to obtain sensitive informations, even when the victim is well protected against common digital attacks. Modern mobile devices allow people to perform some information sensitive actions in unsafe places, where anyone could easily observe the victim while typing. What if your mobile phone has a cool touchscreen interface that gives you graphical feedback as you type (iPhone, Android, BlackBerry Torch)? Does it make shoulder surfing easier or, worse, automatable? We believe so, and to demonstrate it, we developed a practical shoulder surfing attack that automatically reconstructs the sequence of keystrokes by aiming a camera at the target touchscreen while the victim is typing.</p>

      <h2 id="teaching">Teaching and Advising Experience</h2>
      <p>In 2013–2017, I have been a lecturer for the Computer Security course of the 5th School of Engineering (Ingegneria dell’Informazione) of Politecnico di Milano.</p>
      <p>I have been doing teaching since Master of Science (MSc), during which I’ve tutored undergraduate students in computer programming courses (Informatica 1) between 2005 and 2007. In the following list, this activity is referred to as “Lab. Tutor”: this involves guiding students in problem-solving tasks during their programming assignment in laboratory classes. Such classes are taught by so-called “Lab. Teaching Assistants (TAs)”. I was “Lab. TA” between 2007 and 2010 for the same computer programming courses, which meant preparing, solving and testing computer-programming problems of increasing difficulty (mainly in ANSI C), assigning them to students, coordinating the activity of one or two Lab. Tutors, and evaluating the solutions produced by students.</p>
      <p>In 2008–2016 I have been TA for other courses. In particular, I thought classes in computer and network security, graduate-level courses, and prepared and graded exams for such courses. I also prepared and demonstrated practical tutorial lessons (e.g., live penetration testing exercises) to introduce young students to ethical hacking and CTFs. Also, I have been TA for non-security courses on topics such as computer system performance evaluation and information systems. For these courses I was required to teach how to solve practical exercises, prepare and grade exams, and also to prepare homework and small web application for students to request assignments, submit their solutions and automate grading.</p>
